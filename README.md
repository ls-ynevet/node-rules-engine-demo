# Rules Engine PoC

## Description

This project serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for implementing rules engines in Node.js. It utilizes two different rules engines: `@gorules/zen-engine` and `json-rules-engine`.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Usage

### Building the Project

To build the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile TypeScript files to JavaScript files using `tsc` with the `--watch` flag to continuously watch for changes.

### Running the Engine Demos

This project includes two demo scripts for each rules engine:

- `zen-demo.js` for the `@gorules/zen-engine`
- `jre-demo.js` for the `json-rules-engine`

You can start each demo using the following commands:

```bash
npm run start:zen-engine
npm run start:json-rules-engine
```

#### Zen Engine Demo

To start the Zen Engine demo, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start:zen-engine
```

Example output:

```bash
{ performance: '928.25Âµs', result: { scanning: { interval: 120000 } } }
```

#### JSON Rules Engine Demo

To start the JSON Rules Engine demo, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start:json-rules-engine
```

Example output:

```bash
scanning interval:  30000
performance: 1.382125000000002 ms
```
## View & Update The Engines' rulesets
#### Zen Engine
Upload the JDM file `rulesets/blackwidow-jdm.json` into the ZEN Editor in order to visualize & update it: https://editor.gorules.io/


#### JSON Rules Engine
Manualy change the ruleset file: `rulesets/blackwidow-jre.json`
